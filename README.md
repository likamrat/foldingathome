# FOLDING@HOME - Microsoft fight on COVID-19

From the FAH team [website](https://foldingathome.org/about/):

"Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics."

The (FAH Github repo)(https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/coronavirus) had additional details about it's implementation for the COVID-19.

## How does it work?

The FAH team are really the experts! Visit the [FAQ page](https://foldingathome.org/category/how-fah-works/) to learn more. 

## Why did I created this repo?

I wanted to contribute to the effort fighting COVID-19, raising awareness as well as making sure people can deploy and start folding an easy fashion as fast as possible. 

## Let's get started

I have created multiple instructions on how to deploy the FAH client based on the deployment scenarios below.

* [I am a Windows user and just want to install the client and start folding](docs/Windows.md)
* [I am a MacOS user and just want to install the client and start folding](docs/MacOS.md)
* [I don't want to install anything locally but I'm cool with deploying a Docker container](docs/Docker.md)
* [I want to use a "Ready-to-go" Azure VM to do the heavy lifting](docs/Azure.md)
* Hey, I can deploy this on my Kubernetes cluster (TBD)

## Contributing

Please contribute in any way possible and do what make sense to you. The COVID-19 is hitting hard on all of us and we are all in this together! If you have creative ideas please open a pull request or shoot me an email to likamrat@microsoft.com.
